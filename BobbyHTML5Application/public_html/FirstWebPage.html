                        My name is Bobby Donald. I am Junior in Computer Science 
                        at UMass Lowell. I have no experience using HTML or CSS 
                        prior to this class. I do, however, have experience working with C, C++,
                        and Java. I currently work for Prof. Fred Martin in the ECG
                        lab on the iSENSE Project. I work in the lab as an Android 
                        developer.
